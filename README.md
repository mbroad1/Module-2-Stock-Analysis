# Module 2 VBA Challenge: Analyzing Stocks
---
## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the yearly trends in stocks with code that is refactored so that it is more efficient and faster in executing the analysis. With the code that was originally made in Module 2, it is good for analyzing a relatively small number of stocks which means that if more stocks were to be analyzed, then the analysis would take much longer. Therefore, refactoring the code will reduce the analysis time and make the analysis more efficient to be used in the future.
